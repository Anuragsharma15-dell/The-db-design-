# 🗄️ Database & DevOps Hub

A modern, AI-powered **all-in-one web app** for designing, visualizing, exporting database schemas, and managing deployments across multiple platforms.  
Supports **8 database/ORM systems**, **AI-assisted schema generation**, **voice-driven DevOps**, and **deployment debugging** for services like AWS, Azure, Nginx, Kubernetes, and more.  

With this tool, **you no longer need separate DevOps or database tools**—everything is in one hub.

Beautiful er diagrams for your generated schema's to understand the connection between every feild to visualise everything with beautiful diagrams

## ❌ Problem
Developers and DevOps engineers face multiple challenges:  
- Designing and managing database schemas is **complex and repetitive**.  
- Manual schema design often leads to **errors, inconsistencies, and poor scalability**.  
- Exporting schemas consistently across teams is frustrating.  
- Setting up environments and deployments manually slows development.  
- Debugging deployment errors across different platforms (AWS, Azure, Nginx, Kubernetes) is time-consuming and frustrating.  
- Switching between multiple tools for databases, deployment, and monitoring reduces productivity.  
- Lack of AI-driven insights leads to missed **optimizations and best practices**.  

Most developers get **stuck debugging deployments**, wasting hours resolving issues that could be automated or suggested by intelligent tooling.
