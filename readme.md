# 🗄️ Database Schema Designer
A modern, AI-powered web app for creating, visualizing, and exporting database schemas across multiple technologies.  
Supports **8 database/ORM systems**, **AI-assisted schema generation** with **Cerebras** and **LLaMA models**, schema description generation, and production-ready **Docker integration** for seamless deployment.

---


## ❌ Problem
Designing and managing database schemas is often **complex and repetitive**:  
- Developers juggle multiple databases and ORMs with different syntax.  
- Manual schema design can lead to **errors, inconsistencies, and poor scalability**.  
- Exporting schemas across teams in consistent formats is frustrating.  
- Setting up environments manually slows down development and deployment.  
- Lack of AI-driven insights means developers often miss **optimizations and best practices**.  

---

## ✅ Solution
The **Database Schema Designer** streamlines this entire process:  
- 🧩 **One Tool for All**: Design schemas for **8 major database/ORM systems** in a single place.  
- 🤖 **AI Integration**: Use **Cerebras + LLaMA** to generate, explain, and optimize schemas.  
- 📂 **Easy Export**: Export your schemas to **YAML, JSON, and more** with a click.  
- 📖 **Schema Documentation**: Auto-generate clear, human-readable schema descriptions.  
- 🐳 **Dockerized**: Run locally or deploy anywhere with the included **Dockerfile & Compose** setup.  
- 🚀 **Faster Development**: Reduce time spent on boilerplate and focus on building features.
